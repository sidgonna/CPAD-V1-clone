# Privacy Policy for MindDrop

**Last Updated: [Date]**

Thank you for using MindDrop! This Privacy Policy explains how MindDrop handles your information. Our commitment is to your privacy and ensuring that your data remains under your control.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

MindDrop is designed as a **local-first application**. This means:
- **No Personal Data Collection**: We do not collect, store, use, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, location, device identifiers (other than for necessary app functionality like push notifications, if implemented, which MindDrop currently does not use for external communication), or any other data that could be used to identify you personally.
- **No Usage Analytics**: The app does not include any analytics or tracking software that monitors your usage patterns or app interactions for transmission to us or any third party.
- **No Network Requests**: MindDrop does not make any network requests to external servers for its core functionality. All data processing and storage occur locally on your device.

## 2. Information You Create and Store in MindDrop

MindDrop allows you to create and store ideas, which may include:
- Titles
- Text content
- Images (selected from your device or taken with your camera, stored locally)
- Randomly generated visual styles (color gradients and icons, stored locally)

**All data you create within MindDrop is stored exclusively on your local device** within the application's private storage space. This data is not transmitted to, or accessible by, us or any third parties through the MindDrop application.

## 3. How Your Data is Handled

- **Local Storage**: Your ideas, images, and style preferences are stored in a local database and file system on your device.
- **Control Over Your Data**: You have full control over your data. You can add, edit, and delete your ideas and associated visuals directly within the app.
- **Data Deletion**:
    - Deleting an idea within the app will remove its data from the local database and also delete any associated image files stored by the app.
    - Uninstalling the MindDrop application will typically remove all its locally stored data from your device, subject to your operating system's behavior.
- **Data Export**: MindDrop provides functionality to export your data (e.g., as JSON or text files). This exported data is saved to a location you choose on your device or shared via your device's sharing capabilities. The security and handling of this exported data outside of MindDrop are your responsibility.

## 4. Permissions

MindDrop may request the following permissions, solely for its intended local functionality:
- **Storage (Photos/Media/Files)**: To allow you to pick images from your gallery to associate with your ideas, and to save images taken with the in-app camera functionality. Images are stored locally within the app's designated storage area.
- **Camera**: To allow you to take photos to associate with your ideas. Photos taken are stored locally.

We do not access your files or camera for any other purpose.

## 5. Children's Privacy

MindDrop does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since the app operates entirely locally and does not collect PII, it is generally suitable for all ages, subject to the content rating provided on the app stores. If you believe a child has provided us with information in error (e.g., through a support request), please contact us.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app or on our app store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
